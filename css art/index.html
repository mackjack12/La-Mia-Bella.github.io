Know
I would have flown to you
To be where you are
No matter how far
And now that I?m next to you

Especially for you
I want to tell you, you mean all the world to me
How I'm certain that our love was
Meant to be
You changed my life
You showed me the way
And now I'm next to you
I've waited long enough to find you
I want to put all the hurt behind you
And I want to bring out the love
Inside you, oh and
Now were back together, together
I want to show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is
Especially for you
You were in my heart
My love never changed
And now that I?m next to you
No more dreaming about
Tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the
Sorrow
I've got to say
It's all because of you
